# Day 32 – Matplotlib Fundamentals (Data Visualization)

This module demonstrates the use of Matplotlib for creating
basic, clean, and professional data visualizations using Python
inside a virtual environment managed by VS Code.

## What Was Done

- Installed and verified Matplotlib inside project `.venv`
- Created line and bar charts using numerical data
- Added titles, axis labels, and grid for clarity
- Saved plots as image files instead of displaying inline
- Practiced correct folder and path discipline for outputs

## Files Generated

- `plots/sales_line_plot.png` – Line chart showing sales trend
- `plots/sales_bar_chart.png` – Bar chart comparing monthly sales

## Key Learnings

- Matplotlib does not create directories automatically
- Output folders must exist before saving files
- Relative paths depend on the execution directory
- Clean visualization is essential for reports and dashboards

## Outcome

- Matplotlib workflow verified successfully
- Report-ready plots generated
- Foundation established for analytics, BI prep, and dashboards
