# Module 03 — VS Code Editing Superpowers for Data & BI Engineering

**VS CODE MASTER PROGRAM – Pilot Edition V1.0**  
**Module Status:** Completed ✅  
**Program Track:** VS Code – Zero to Hero

---

## Module Objective

Module 03 focuses on mastering Visual Studio Code as a **high-productivity editor** for real-world **Data Engineering, BI Dashboarding, and ETL workflows**.

The emphasis is on **practical editing efficiency, structural correctness, formatter discipline, and debugging mindset**—not classroom theory. This module bridges the gap between basic VS Code usage and the **professional daily workflow** used by Data Analysts, BI Developers, and Data Engineers.

---

## Learning Philosophy

This module follows a **practical-first, mistake-driven approach**:

- Real files, real errors, real fixes
- Tool behavior understood deeply, not memorized
- Editor mastery aligned to **Data + BI + SQL + Python** work
- Focus on repeatable professional workflows

---

## Module Coverage (Day-wise)

### Day 15 — Keyboard Shortcuts Mastery

- Line duplication, movement, and deletion
- Multi-line selection and refactoring
- Efficient CSV editing using shortcuts
- Productivity patterns for large datasets

---

### Day 16 — Multi-Cursor Editing & Data Cleaning

- Large CSV cleanup (`sales_messy_large.csv`)
- Case normalization (UPPER → lower)
- Space cleanup before and after delimiters
- Regex-based search and replace
- Understanding VS Code search scope and regex mode

---

### Day 17 — HTML Structure & BI Dashboard Editing

**Dashboard Workspace Created**
Files used:

- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`
- `data.json`

Key learnings:

- Emmet concepts and real-world limitations
- Manual HTML structuring as a professional fallback strategy
- Debugging structural HTML errors (double `<body>`, mis-nesting)
- Live Server usage
- Browser Console debugging (404 errors, MIME type issues)
- Fixing missing script loading issues
- Successfully binding JSON data to KPI UI

**Outcome:**  
A working BI dashboard displaying live KPI values loaded dynamically from `data.json`.

---

### Day 18 — Formatting Rules & Workspace Discipline

- Python formatter setup using **Black**
- Understanding formatter responsibility per language
- Fixing broken `settings.json` (JSON structure discipline)
- Workspace vs User settings clarity
- Python auto-format on save enabled
- SQL formatting behavior explained (manual vs formatter-based)
- Professional SQL readability achieved using editor skills

---

## Tools & Features Mastered

- VS Code Explorer and workspace layout
- Multi-cursor editing
- Regex search and replace
- Live Server
- Browser DevTools (Console debugging)
- Black Formatter (Python)
- Prettier (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)
- Workspace-level `settings.json`
- Manual SQL formatting using editor power

This structure is **production-ready** and suitable for **GitHub portfolio showcase**.

---

## Module Outcomes

By the end of Module 03, the learner can:

- Edit large data files confidently and efficiently
- Perform complex refactoring using multi-cursor and regex tools
- Build and debug HTML structures without dependency on shortcuts
- Understand formatter limitations and configure them professionally
- Debug real browser and tooling errors independently
- Maintain clean, readable Python and SQL code
- Use VS Code as a **primary professional tool**, not just an editor

---

## Final Note

Module 03 establishes **editor-level mastery** required for high-velocity SQL development, ETL pipelines, BI dashboards, and cloud-based workflows.

The skills developed here directly enable the **Analytics Engineering and Validation workflows** introduced in **Module 04**.
