# VS Code – Zero to Hero

VS CODE MASTER PROGRAM – Pilot Edition V1.0

This repository documents my structured journey to master **Visual Studio Code as a professional engineering environment**, progressing from foundational setup to analytics engineering–grade SQL workflows.

The program follows a **module-based, production-minded approach**, focusing on real tools, real errors, and real-world workflows rather than tutorial-style learning.

---

## Program Philosophy

This is not a “how to use VS Code” tutorial repository.

It is a **professional mastery program** designed to:

- Build strong foundations before advanced workflows
- Treat tooling as part of engineering discipline
- Emphasize correctness, validation, and reproducibility
- Prepare work that is explainable in interviews and portfolios

All modules were developed and validated **inside VS Code**, using real project structures and realistic constraints.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Visual Studio Code
- SQLite
- SQL
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub

---

## Learning Approach

- Hands-on, module-based progression
- Real project structures, not toy examples
- Debugging and validation treated as core skills
- Documentation-first mindset
- Each module builds logically on the previous one

---

## Outcome

By completing this program, I developed the ability to:

- Use VS Code as a **primary professional development platform**
- Build clean, scalable workspaces for long-term projects
- Debug code confidently across languages
- Prepare analytics-ready SQL layers for BI tools
- Apply engineering discipline to data and tooling workflows

This repository represents a **completed, end-to-end mastery journey**, not an ongoing experiment.
